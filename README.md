I jumped past lots of basic coding languages and jumped to Javascript for a discord bot, It was a semi-good bot, but it lacked much use.
So I realized most useful/well-known bots use very advanced programming for my tiny brain, and I started to go back to HTML cause I forgot what I learned from 4th grade.
Now im currently learning HTML with skillshare!
